# Why use Django REST Framework?

From the [FAQ](http://django-rest-framework.org/howto/alternativeframeworks.html):

> The big benefits of using Django REST framework come down to:
>
> 1. It’s based on Django’s class based views, which makes it simple, modular,
>     and future-proof.
> 2. It stays as close as possible to Django idioms and language throughout.
> 3. The browse-able API makes working with the APIs extremely quick and easy.
